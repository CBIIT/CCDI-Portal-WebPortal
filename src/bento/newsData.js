The plan offers something for everyone who wants to join in creating a society where more cancers are prevented and every person with cancer lives a full and active life.&nbsp;</p>'
        +'<p>At its core, the National Cancer Plan features eight goals that build on our current knowledge and describe an ideal future state&mdash;essential components to ending cancer as we know it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>'

        +'<p>Everything at NCI helps to drive progress toward these goals. The National Cancer Plan helps to describe ongoing and emerging initiatives and invites others to do the same.&nbsp; The better NCI and its partners can identify gaps in cancer prevention, detection, treatment, and care, the better all communities are able to work across society to address them.&nbsp;</p>',
