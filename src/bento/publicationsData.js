        summary: `<p>Pediatric brain and spinal cancers are collectively the leading disease-related cause of death in children; thus, we urgently need curative therapeutic strategies for these tumors. To accelerate such discoveries, the Children's Brain Tumor Network (CBTN) and Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium (PNOC) created a systematic process for tumor biobanking, model generation, and sequencing with immediate access to harmonized data. We leverage these data to establish OpenPBTA, an open collaborative project with over 40 scalable analysis modules that genomically characterize 1,074 pediatric brain tumors. Transcriptomic classification reveals universal TP53 dysregulation in mismatch repair-deficient hypermutant high-grade gliomas and TP53 loss as a significant marker for poor overall survival in ependymomas and H3 K28-mutant diffuse midline gliomas. Already being actively applied to other pediatric cancers and PNOC molecular tumor board decision-making, OpenPBTA is an invaluable resource to the pediatric oncology community.</p>`,

        summary: `<p>In March 2023, over 800 researchers, clinicians, patients, survivors, and advocates from the pediatric oncology community met to discuss the progress of the National Cancer Institute's Childhood Cancer Data Initiative. We present here the status of the initiative's efforts in building its data ecosystem and updates on key programs, especially the Molecular Characterization Initiative and the planned Coordinated National Initiative for Rare Cancers in Children and Young Adults. These activities aim to improve access to childhood cancer data, foster collaborations, facilitate integrative data analysis, and expand access to molecular characterization, ultimately leading to the development of innovative therapeutic approaches.</p>`,

        summary: `<p>Data-driven basic, translational, and clinical research has resulted in improved outcomes for children, adolescents, and young adults (AYAs) with pediatric cancers. However, challenges in sharing data between institutions, particularly in research, prevent addressing substantial unmet needs in children and AYA patients diagnosed with certain pediatric cancers. Systematically collecting and sharing data from every child and AYA can enable greater understanding of pediatric cancers, improve survivorship, and accelerate development of new and more effective therapies. To accomplish this goal, the Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI) was launched in 2019 at the National Cancer Institute. CCDI is a collaborative community endeavor supported by a 10-year, $50-million (in US dollars) annual federal investment. CCDI aims to learn from every patient diagnosed with a pediatric cancer by designing and building a data ecosystem that facilitates data collection, sharing, and analysis for researchers, clinicians, and patients across the cancer community. For example, CCDI's Molecular Characterization Initiative provides comprehensive clinical molecular characterization for children and AYAs with newly diagnosed cancers. Through these efforts, the CCDI strives to provide clinical benefit to patients and improvements in diagnosis and care through data-focused research support and to build expandable, sustainable data resources and workflows to advance research well past the planned 10 years of the initiative. Importantly, if CCDI demonstrates the success of this model for pediatric cancers, similar approaches can be applied to adults, transforming both clinical research and treatment to improve outcomes for all patients with cancer.</p>`,
